As a Youtuber with youtube channel - [Vaishu_uff](https://www.youtube.com/channel/vaishu_uff) I was always fascinated about how youtube works and how it handle tons of data every second. Being a developer, I always wanted to build my own youtube and experiment with my youtube. I have just started with the project and hope to make it full stack project with adding other essential things such as handling the server and data just to try my hands on it.   

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
